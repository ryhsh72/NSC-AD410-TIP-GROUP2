Status Report #3

4/14/17
Mid-Tier Team

1. Met with team on Thursday to discuss GitHub etiquette (use forks for
personal back-up for repo, branches for public development), further
deliberation on user stories (formatting, order of importance, etc.), and how
user stories may be divided up in the future. Front-end's implementation
of the Tool-Tip feature assuaged most of our worries about complexity of
the feature.

2. Further seeking to refine user stories, in epic form along with a
minute form similar to front-end's stories (really like their detail!), along
with further reading up on Survey.js (contact dev team and ask about our
non-profit status, then communicate with rest of the group for further
development).

3. Will have to discuss with group the optimal method of utilizing SQLite
with PHP scripting, along with further Survey.js research
